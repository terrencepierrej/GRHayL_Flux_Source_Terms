    "\n",
    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special thanks to Roland Haas for help in answering many implementation questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook generates `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum`, [Einstein Toolkit](https://einsteintoolkit.org) thorns for solving Einstein's equations in the BSSN formalism, in Cartesian coordinates. These thorns are highly optimized for modern CPU architectures, featuring SIMD intrinsics and OpenMP support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Status:** <font color='orange'><b> Validated against the Einstein Toolkit `McLachlan` BSSN thorn, both in the context of black hole binary simulations (excellent gravitational waveform agreement) as well as binary neutron star simulations (when parameter `enable_stress_energy_source_terms` below is set to `True`). Once plots demonstrating this agreement are added to this tutorial notebook, the validation status will be set to</b></font> <font color='green'><b>Validated</b></font>.\n",

    "```\n",
    "How often did my soul cry out:\n",
    "Come back to Baikal once again?\n",
    "I still do not know this lake:\n",
    "To see does not mean to know.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Igor Severyanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Severyanin), [[1]](https://1baikal.ru/en/istoriya/let’s-turn-to-baikal-a-poetic-view).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal) is home to the [nerpa seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_seal), NRPy+'s mascot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates two thorns: `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum`. `Baikal` contains stress-energy source terms (i.e., the $8\\pi T^{\\mu\\nu}$ part of Einstein's equations) for general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) and magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD), and the `BaikalVacuum` contains no such source terms, so can be used for e.g., black hole and binary black hole calculations in which no self-gravitating matter is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` are meant to reproduce the functionality of the `McLachlan` thorn, generated by the [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)-based [Kranc](http://kranccode.org/) code, but using the fully open-source NRPy+/SymPy infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `McLachlan`, `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` enable the user at runtime to select only the most popular options, like finite-difference order and Kreiss-Oliger dissipation strength. Further, neither thorn yet supports symmetry options or Jacobians needed for `Llama` grids. Support for these options might be provided in a future update. As for BSSN gauge choice, `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` by default support only the BSSN moving-puncture gauge conditions, though this can be changed by selecting one of the [other gauge choices implemented within the NRPy+ infrastructure](Tutorial-BSSN_time_evolution-BSSN_gauge_RHSs.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding the structure of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As generating the optimized C code kernels needed for these thorns can *individually* take roughly 10 minutes per finite-difference order, there is a strong motivation to parallelize the code generation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, this Jupyter notebook makes use of Python's [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module, which spawns an independent Python interpreter to construct individual C-code kernels. On a modern, multi-core CPU, this greatly cuts down the time needed to generate the thorns (sometimes by 10x or more), all while ensuring a convenient user interface for adjusting the thorns to suit one's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant complication arises with the use of `multiprocessing`: the NRPy+ environment. Each Python interpreter inherits the NRPy+ environment of the parent interpreter from which it spawns. Within each interpreter NRPy+ registers an additional individual C function within NRPy+'s [`outputC`](outputC.py) module. But how to combine all of these individual NRPy+ environments back into the parent after `multiprocessing` is run? The answer lies in NRPy+'s [`pickling`](pickling.py) module, which uses Python's built-in [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module to store (\"pickle\") an entire NRPy+ environment and add it to the parent NRPy+ environment (\"unpickle\").\n",

As a result, although NRPy+ can in principle output an infinite variety of C code kernels for solving Einstein's equations, generally free parameters in each kernel steerable at *runtime* are restricted to simple scalars. This leads to more optimized kernels (i.e., significantly improved performance as compared to `McLachlan`), but at the expense of flexibility in choosing e.g., different gauges at runtime (currently only the most commonly used gauge is supported), as well as the need to generate multiple kernels (one per finite-differencing order).

    "As described above, a significant complication arises with the use of `multiprocessing`: the NRPy+ environment. Each Python interpreter inherits the NRPy+ environment of the parent interpreter from which it spawns. Within each interpreter NRPy+ registers an additional individual C function within NRPy+'s [`outputC`](outputC.py) module. But how to combine all of these individual NRPy+ environments back into the parent after `multiprocessing` is run? The answer lies in NRPy+'s [`pickling`](pickling.py) module, which uses Python's built-in [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module to store (\"pickle\") an entire NRPy+ environment and add it to the parent NRPy+ environment (\"unpickle\")."

As parameters and gridfunctions are registered with NRPy+ when the C-code kernels are generated, and this generation occurs on separate processes in parallel, we store the entire NRPy+ environment for *each* process. This results in a tremendous amount of duplication, which is sorted out next. Once all duplicated environment variables (e.g., registered gridfunctions) are removed, we replace the current NRPy+ environment with the new one, by setting `gri.glb_gridfcs_list[],par.glb_params_list[],par.glb_Cparams_list[]`."

    "\n",
    "Here, we will find the speeds at which the hydrodynamics waves propagate. We start from the speed of light (since FFE deals with very diffuse plasmas), which is $c=1.0$ in our chosen units. We then find the speeds $c_+$ and $c_-$ on each face with the function `find_cp_cm`; then, we find minimum and maximum speeds possible from among those. A complete derivation of these speeds is included [below](#derive_speed) as an appendix; here, for brevity, we simply start with the implementation of the code in the original `GiRaFFE`. That code itself is adapted from the more general `IllinoisGRMHD` code; we will implement several more simplifications to help improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the source code for `find_cp_cm`, edited to work with the NRPy+ version of `GiRaFFE`. One edit we need to make in particular is to the term `psim4*gupii` in the definition of `c`; that was written assuming the use of the conformal metric $\\tilde{g}^{ii}$. Since we are not using that here, and are instead using the ADM metric, we should not multiply by $\\psi^{-4}$.\n",

    "We could use this code directly, but there's substantial improvement we can make by changing the code into a NRPyfied form. Note the `if` statement; NRPy+ does not know how to handle these, so we must eliminate it if we want to leverage NRPy+'s full power. (Calls to `fabs()` are also cheaper than `if` statements.) This can be done if we rewrite this, taking inspiration from the other eliminated `if` statement documented in the above code block:\n",

    "  cminus = 0.5*(cp+cm-fabs(cp-cm));\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be simplified further, by substituting `cp` and `cm` into the below equations and eliminating terms as appropriate. First note that `cp+cm = -b/a` and that `cp-cm = detm/a`. Thus,\n",
    "```c\n",

    "\n",
    "This leaves us with an expression that can be much more easily NRPyfied. So, we will rewrite the following in NRPy+, making only minimal changes to be proper Python. However, it turns out that we can make this even simpler. In GRFFE, $v_0^2$ is guaranteed to be exactly one. In GRMHD, this speed was calculated as $$v_{0}^{2} = v_{\\rm A}^{2} + c_{\\rm s}^{2}\\left(1-v_{\\rm A}^{2}\\right),$$ where the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_{\\rm A}^{2}$ $$v_{\\rm A}^{2} = \\frac{b^{2}}{\\rho_{b}h + b^{2}}.$$ So, we can see that when the density $\\rho_b$ goes to zero, $v_{0}^{2} = v_{\\rm A}^{2} = 1$.

Thus, `detm/a` is guaranteed to be positive itself, rendering the calls to `nrpyAbs()` superfluous. Furthermore, we eliminate any dependence on the Valencia 3-velocity and the time compoenent of the four-velocity, $u^0$.

    "This computes phase speeds in the direction given by `flux_dirn`. Note that we replace the full dispersion relation with a simpler one, which overestimates the maximum speeds by a factor of ~2. See full discussion around Eqs. 49 and 50 in [Duez, et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503420.pdf). In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
